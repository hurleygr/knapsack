# knapsack

This program solves the 0-1 knapsack problem provided a user input of capacity and a file named data.txt containing possible knapsack additions.
It can be run by adding the data.txt file to the same directory as this file, entering terminal and typing python3 run knapSack.py, and entering a capacity when prompted. Outputs will be the table built by dynamic programming, the solution, and the subset of weights making up the solution in that order.
